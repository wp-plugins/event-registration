== Installation ==

1. After unzipping, upload everything in the `Events Registration` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (preserving directory structure).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Event Registration Menu and Configure Organization and enter your company info - note you will need a paypal id if you plan on accepting paypal payments
4. Go to the Event Setup and create a new event, make sure you select 'make active'.
5. Create a new page (not post) on your site. Put `{EVENTREGIS}` in it on a line by itself.
6. Note: if you are upgradings from a previous version please backup your data prior to upgrade.

If you would like to put a specific event on a page use `[Event_Registration_Single id="1"]` where 1 is the event id number.  Make sure that you have display all events active in the Configure Organization Tab.  Yes you can still use `{EVENTREGIS}` at the same time!

All done.
