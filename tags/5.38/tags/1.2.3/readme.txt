== Description ==

Provides the ability to setup event list and accept online registrations for events and administer them via WordPress.

I tried to find a plugin to suit my needs to have a quick and efficient way to provide online registrations for the various events an organization may have or sponsor.  
I could not find a simple solution and most online services charge $1.00 per registered person plus a % of the fee, this can get expensive quickly, thus the need for my plugin.
This wordpress plugin is designed to run on a Wordpress webpage and provide registration for an event. It allows you to capture the registering persons contact information to a 
database and provides an association to an events database. It provides the ability to send the register to your paypal payment site for online collection of event fees. 
Reporting features provide a list of events, list of attendees to excel export.

I will be working on this to improve as I have a list of improvements I need right away, but I thought I would get it out there and see if others liked/could use it.  email questions or comments to consultant@avdude.com.  If you like 
the plugin and find it useful, your donations would also help me keep it going and improve it.  You can donate and find online information at www.avdude.com


== Installation ==

1. After unzipping, upload everything in the `Events Registration` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (preserving directory structure).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Event Registration Menu and Configure Organization and enter your company info - note you will need a paypal id if you plan on accepting paypal payments
4. Go to the Event Setup and create a new event, make sure you select 'make active'.
5. Create a new page (not post) on your site. Put `{EVENTREGIS}` in it on a line by itself.

All done.
